## Hey 👋

I'm a French student in web development 👨‍🎓

## My favorite technologies / tools 💻

I mainly develop with the Symfony framework in PHP, with additional technologies such as Twig, Stimulus and API Platform

And of course I'm part of the VS Code and VIM team 🤘🏻

```php
<?php
while (true) {
    eat();
    sleep();
    code();
}
```
